configs
=======

Here I will upload personal configs that I find useful and feel like having an online repository would be useful. These configs will contain things like .bashrc and .xinitrc. This will also contain other config files I find useful to migrate from one machine to another.

Instructions:
Copy everything within the celce directory into your home directory or to make it default for new users copy it into / to replace the required files. The files in /etc/skel can then be added to /home/user.
